LabMan - Laboratory Management System
======================================

Please see README.md for complete documentation.

This Django-based laboratory management system provides equipment booking,
user management, cost tracking, and hierarchical organisation of laboratory
resources for research facilities.

A key safety feature is the management of risk assessments and standard
operating procedures (SOPs), requiring users to acknowledge safety documents
before being granted equipment booking rights.
